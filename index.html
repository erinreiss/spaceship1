              Although the City of Alameda is just over the Bay Bridge from San Francisco, it has a small town feel. Residents brag that it is “a city frozen in time,” where the crime rate is notably lower than Oakland, its neighbor to the east. And relations between police and residents of color are not as tense as in the City of Alameda as they are in other nearby communities, like Hayward and Oakland. But Alameda residents and police officers consume the same news –  from viral videos of shootings to courtroom decisions on police brutality – as the rest of the nation. The city’s young men and women of color express much of the same anger, fear, and concern as their counterparts around the country. They, too, share a distrust of law enforcement. Meanwhile, officers at the Alameda Police Department (APD) say they often feel misjudged, isolated, embattled.

        We started by interviewing five APD officers (there are more than 80 sworn officers in the department), including a student resource officer stationed at Encinal High School. We then met with the roughly 25 students in Gene Kahane’s Sports and Literature class, composed mostly of juniors and seniors, and sat down for one-on-one interviews with nine of them. We asked everyone a few basic questions – what they thought of the other group, what they thought the other group thought of them, what they wanted to know about the other group, and what they wanted the other group to know about them. Then Aaron Reiss, who led the project, ferried the questions and answers back and forth between officers and students, doing additional reporting along the way.

          <span id="intro2_sub0">Unlike a traditional news story, this piece is mostly comprised of large, continuous quotes from interviewees. Our goal was to make sure the participants’ words are heard. As with any story, this represents a small sliver of the the whole — of the conversations students and officers had. Each interviewee held a complex web of beliefs, opinions, and emotions. In some places, we’ve highlighted points of view from one person that were shared by many.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span id="intro2_sub1">The conversation between students and officers was wide ranging. It moved from the complexities and potential abuses of “probable cause,” to the emotional toll of policing on officers themselves, to 911 response procedure and everywhere in between. The interactive below is one line of conversation that grew out of this dialogue.</span>

        So we started there, with the officer's’ desire to know how much of local mistrust or antipathy toward police was coming from the media (from footage and descriptions of violence in other places) and how much of it was coming from students’ lived experience. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We took this question to the students...

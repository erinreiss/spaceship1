              Although the City of Alameda is just over the Bay Bridge from San Francisco, it has a small town feel. Residents brag that it is “a city frozen in time,” where the crime rate is notably lower than Oakland, its neighbor to the east. And relations between police and residents of color are not as tense as in the City of Alameda as they are in other nearby communities, like Hayward and Oakland. But Alameda residents and police officers consume the same news –  from viral videos of shootings to courtroom decisions on police brutality – as the rest of the nation. The city’s young men and women of color express much of the same anger, fear, and concern as their counterparts around the country. They, too, share a distrust of law enforcement. Meanwhile, officers at the Alameda Police Department (APD) say they often feel misjudged, isolated, embattled.

        We started by interviewing five APD officers (there are more than 80 sworn officers in the department), including a student resource officer stationed at Encinal High School. We then met with the roughly 25 students in Gene Kahane’s Sports and Literature class, composed mostly of juniors and seniors, and sat down for one-on-one interviews with nine of them. We asked everyone a few basic questions – what they thought of the other group, what they thought the other group thought of them, what they wanted to know about the other group, and what they wanted the other group to know about them. Then Aaron Reiss, who led the project, ferried the questions and answers back and forth between officers and students, doing additional reporting along the way.

Our goal was to make sure the participants’ words are heard. As with any story, this represents a small sliver of the the whole — of the conversations students and officers had. Each interviewee held a complex web of beliefs, opinions, and emotions. In some places, we’ve highlighted points of view from one person that were shared by many.</span>

          <span id="intro2_sub1">The conversation between students and officers was wide ranging. It moved from the complexities and potential abuses of “probable cause,” to the emotional toll of policing on officers themselves, to 911 response procedure and everywhere in between. The interactive below is one line of conversation that grew out of this dialogue.</span>

        So we started there, with the officer's’ desire to know how much of local mistrust or antipathy toward police was coming from the media (from footage and descriptions of violence in other places) and how much of it was coming from students’ lived experience. 
        <br>
        <br>

            In discussions about racial stereotyping and racial bias in policing, officers spoke passionately about the seriousness of the issue and how swiftly and severely it should be dealt with when identified. They talked mostly about it in reference to policing in general and society-wide racism. When appraising the state of policing in Alameda, officers generally offered that they had not seen profiling in action locally, though they talked about how sometimes their work requires them to filter through the biases of the community.

            Regardless of their impressions of the role race plays in policing in Alameda, officers are thinking deeply about the national focus on these issues. A key thread in those conversations – often an accusation – is that all officers act based on racial bias, whether they know it or not. Research shows that all police, like all people, have implicit biases (internal, unconscious ideas  that guide their actions and reactions). Alicea, who has been an officer at the APD for 10 years, participates in a one such academic study of implicit bias training for police, led by faculty in UC Berkeley’s Public Policy department.

            Many officers have had first-hand exposure to local racism and bias. Dave, a 25-year veteran of the APD, told a story from years ago, when he responded to a 911 call at the Alameda home of a white family, only to have the family ask him to go away and send back a white police officer. Perhaps most interesting to students, is that the police felt they could be instruments of the biases of community members. Several interviewed officers recalled frustration and anger in times when they felt they were responsible for responding to calls they felt were overtly motivated by race.

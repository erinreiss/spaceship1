          Although The City of Alameda is just over the bridge from San Francisco, residents brag that their city feels like “a small town, frozen in time.” With its picturesque, suburban lawns and its quaint shopping streets, The City of Alameda does seem to move at a slower pace than its neighbors to the east and west (Oakland and San Francisco). Local craft shops sell tote-bags that read “Welcome to Alameda: Speed Limit 25mph Strictly enforced.” That many residents take pride in their famously stringent traffic laws may speak to “frozen in time” nature of the town.

              While nearby cities like Oakland, Hayward, and San Francisco been deeply embroiled in discussions about policing and race currently raging in America, relations between police and residents of color here in the City of Alameda are notably less heated. However, these issues are certainly not absent and Alameda residents and police officers consume the same news – from viral videos of shootings to courtroom decisions on police brutality – as the rest of the nation.

        We started by interviewing five APD officers (there are more than 80 sworn officers in the department), including a student resource officer stationed at Encinal High School. We then met with the roughly 25 students in Gene Kahane’s Sports and Literature class, composed mostly of juniors and seniors, and sat down for one-on-one interviews with nine of them. We asked everyone a few basic questions – what they thought of the other group, what they thought the other group thought of them, what they wanted to know about the other group, and what they wanted the other group to know about them. Then Aaron Reiss, who led the project, ferried the questions and answers back and forth between officers and students, doing additional reporting along the way.

Our goal was to make sure the participants’ words were heard.

Each interviewee held a complex web of beliefs, opinions, and emotions. In some places, we’ve highlighted points of view from one person that were shared by many.</span>

        So we started there, with the officers’ desire to know how much of local mistrust or antipathy toward police was coming from the media (from footage and descriptions of violence in other places), and how much of it was coming from students’ lived experience.

            In discussions about racial stereotyping and racial bias in policing, officers spoke passionately about the seriousness of the issue and how swiftly and severely it should be dealt with when identified. They talked mostly about it in reference to policing in general and society-wide racism. When appraising the state of policing in Alameda, officers generally offered that they had not seen profiling in action locally, though they talked about how sometimes their work requires them to filter through the biases of the community.

            Regardless of their impressions of the role race plays in policing in Alameda, officers are thinking deeply about the national focus on these issues. A key thread in those conversations – often an accusation – is that all officers act based on racial bias, whether they know it or not. Research shows that all police, like all people, have implicit biases (internal, unconscious ideas  that guide their actions and reactions). Alicea, who has been an officer at the APD for 10 years, participates in one such academic study of implicit bias training for police, led by faculty in UC Berkeley’s Public Policy department.

            Many officers have had first-hand exposure to local racism and bias. Dave, a 25-year veteran of the APD, told a story from years ago, when he responded to a 911 call at the Alameda home of a white family, only to have the family ask him to go away and send back a white police officer. Perhaps most interesting to students, is that the police felt they could be instruments of the biases of community members. Several interviewed officers recalled frustration and anger in times when they were responsible for responding to calls they felt were overtly motivated by race.

            For students, these stories brought on a powerful realization: that officers witness bias, and are willing to open up about it. It brought out in these young people impassioned responses and new questions. Many connected experiences of officers like Dave and Alicea to the calls for increased police accountability that they see in the news and on social media. And they voiced a strong desire for officers to speak up about wrongs they see in a more public way.

          This project was conceived of by Spaceship Media, a nonprofit that is aims to broker conversations between groups at odds. With officers and students in Alameda, we provided space where questions could be asked, and helped elaborate on the answers given.
          <br>
          <br>
          These conversations were not always comfortable and were not always easy. But they were real attempts to bridge misunderstanding and misconceptions between police officers and young people in Alameda. Spaceship Media will continue to explore new ways to use reporting to build empathy and appreciation of the complexity of the roles that we inhabit and the world that we share.

            We are grateful to the students of Encinal High School and the officers of Alameda for their generosity and openness. This project was only made possible by the support of Alameda Police Police Chief Paul Rolleri and Gene Kahane at Encinal High School. We are grateful for their curiosity and trust as they worked with us to dig into a deeper conversation.

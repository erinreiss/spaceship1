  Other Questions from Students
  </div>

  <div class="faqSubTitle">
  Over the course of our project with Encinal Students and Alameda Police Officers, we discussed all manner of topics and questions important to the two groups. Below we collect some of the other lines of conversation.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="faqBody">

  <div class="faqQ">Can any officer respond to any call? Like, can the campus officer respond to a robbery or a murder?</div>

  <div class="faqA">Mostly yes. There are officers who have certain specialties (for example, negotiation) and they might be called in specifically. An officer who is assigned to a specific location like a school would probably only be called away from duty for an emergency or if other officers were all tied up on other calls. But when the campus officer isn’t on campus, he is on all kinds of calls in the community. Also, Sergeants (who oversee patrol officers) are required to be on site for certain kinds of calls (if there is a death, a mental health issue, etc.)</div>

  <div class="faqQ">Why will so many cops roll up on a small issue?</div>

  <div class="faqA">There is usually one officer per car in Alameda — this is so that the APD can be in more places at once. But for the safety of officers, two cars are usually sent to each call (it is not good practice to go into any call without backup). But for a lot of calls, the potential danger is unclear (let’s say you get a call for drunk in public — what if the guy has a weapon? You might not know...) so if there is any chance of violence, or it is just unclear what the situation might be, additional cars will often be sent if they are available.</div>
